🎹 Piano Website
What I Did

I created a piano website where users can play piano sounds.

How I Did It

I used HTML to create the piano keys

I used CSS to style the piano

I used JavaScript to make the piano interactive

What I Used

HTML tags like div and audio

CSS for layout and design

JavaScript with functions, querySelectorAll(), forEach(), and event listeners

Piano sound files

What It Does

When a user clicks a piano key, a sound plays

It also plays sounds when keyboard keys are pressed 🎶
